# Implementation Rules

## Commit Policy

**NEVER commit without explicit approval from the user.**

The user will always test the changes locally before approving them. 

**Rule:** Modify what is requested but DO NOT commit until explicit instruction to make the commit, as testing will always be done before committing.
